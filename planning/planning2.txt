Pydantic Classes
*******************

Assume I am an experienced java programmer that is trying to find out the capabiliites of Pydantic python library.

1. Tell me all of its high level capabilities
2. Give some examples of those capabilities
3. what are some lesser known uses of Pydantic library


Typing
***************
1. Can you give some examples of type hints in the latest python releases, especially using collections in a type safe way. 
2. If any imports are needed show the imports
3. Place all the imports at the top of the code
4. I don't need a function example, but just code snippets

Type checking
********************
is there a function in python that asserts if an object is of certain type

Write me a function: assertType(object: Any, typename, message: str)
1. It shoudl check if the arg "object" is of type "typename" in python
2. if it is not raise an appropriate exception, by somehow including the passed in message as part of the exception message
