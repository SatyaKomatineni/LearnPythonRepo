# Design thoughts on applications
*****************************************
Main ideas:

1. Configuration objects
2. How interfaces can indicate their constructor dependencies!
3. Docs: Application classes, interfaces and implementations
4. Dual instantiations
5. Optimize factory object cache locking for non singletons

## Configuration objects
*****************************************
1. Provide for configuration data objects
2. By extending or tagging as ConfigObject the factory will fill and return
3. One way to objectify configuration with or without behavior
4. A future factory implementation can do that


## How interfaces can indicate their constructor dependencies!
*****************************************
1. Have the factory take an "object" as part of its construction
2. Let the interface provide a class method that could take arguments and return an object of the right type!
3. Pass that method to the factory
4. factory will then initialize the derived classes with that object

### cautions
*****************************************
1. There could be a class of implementations where the constructor could differ
2. Example: filename based configurations vs database based configurations!
3. This "knowledge" is ensconced  in the "implementation" and not in the interface!!
4. Have hybrid interfaces (factories) like "FileBasedConfig" that knows the args of that class

## Docs: Application classes, interfaces and implementations
*****************************************

# Dual instantiations
***************************
1. Factory classes assume that they are instantiated from configuration
2. Some times you may want to instantiate them programmatically like say when you want to test them
3. Provide an approach for it
4. Is that through a constructor? or an explicit disciplined init method?
5. Or through dependency injection to unify both methods?

# Optimize factory object cache locking for non singletons
*****************************************
1. Right now the cache is locked for multi instance classes every time
2. Although a class doesnt require caching, one may not know that until the object is instantiated
3. Couple of ways
    1. Ask the class itself and not the object instance for that decision
    2. Provide a hint in the config file against that class (probably not)
